## Installation

### Automagically
In your Sanity project's directory run :

```
sanity install media-library
```

### Manually

```
yarn add sanity-plugin-media-library
```

or

```
npm install --save sanity-plugin-media-library
```

#### Adding the library
In your `sanity.json` add it to the list of plugins:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@sanity/base",
    "@sanity/components",
    "@sanity/default-layout",
    "@sanity/default-login",
    "@sanity/desk-tool",
    "media-library"
  ]
}
```

## Installing as asset source
Using the media library as an asset source requires a little more configuration.
In your `sanity.json` add the following to the `parts` array:

```json
{
  "implements": "part:@sanity/form-builder/input/image/asset-source",
  "path": "./assetSource.js"
}
```

And in `assetSource.js` add:

```javascript
import AssetSource from "part:sanity-plugin-media-library/asset-source";
export default [AssetSource];
```

Done, you're ready to go!

## Configuration / Theming
After installing the plugin, a config file is automatically created at `config/media-library.json`.

In this file you can set the theme to `light` or `dark` and optionally add themeChanges. For a list of available options see the keys in [/src/themes/darkTheme.ts](/src/themes/darkTheme.ts).

```json
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "themeChanges": {}
}
```

Example with themeChanges:
```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "themeChanges": {
    "bottomBarBorderColor": "hotpink",
    "buttonPrimaryBorderColor": "hotpink"
  }
}
```
