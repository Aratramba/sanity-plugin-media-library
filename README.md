## Installation

### Automagically

In your Sanity project's directory run :

```
sanity install media-library
```

### Manually

```
yarn add sanity-plugin-media-library
```

or

```
npm install --save sanity-plugin-media-library
```

#### Adding the library

In your `sanity.json` add it to the list of plugins:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@sanity/base",
    "@sanity/components",
    "@sanity/default-layout",
    "@sanity/default-login",
    "@sanity/desk-tool",
    "media-library"
  ]
}
```

---

### Using the Media Library

#### Setting Globally

By default the media library will be added to all image fields, next to any other asset sources you might have. You can customise this behaviour in your `sanity.json` by adding the following to the `parts` array:

```json
{
  "implements": "part:@sanity/form-builder/input/image/asset-sources",
  "path": "./assetSources.js"
}
```

In `assetSources.js`:

```javascript
import AssetSource from 'part:sanity-plugin-media-library/asset-source';
export default [AssetSource];
```

#### Setting per field

If you want to define the media library for specific fields, you can set the sources option on your field:

```js
import AssetSource from 'part:sanity-plugin-media-library/asset-source';

export default {
  name: 'mySchema',
  type: 'document',
  title: 'My Schema',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'image',
      type: 'image',
      title: 'Image',
      options: { sources: [AssetSource] },
    },
  ],
};
```

See [Sanity Custom Asset Sources](https://www.sanity.io/docs/custom-asset-sources) for more options.

## Theming

In the 2.0.0 release support for custom themes has been dropped, the interface is built using [Sanity UI](sanity.io/ui). If you want to continue theming, pick a version in the 1.0.x range.

---

## Configuration

After installing the plugin, a config file is automatically created at `config/media-library.json`.

Example with asset fields listed and custom fields added:

```json
{
  "customFields": [
    {
      "label": "Additional description",
      "name": "description",
      "placeholder": "No description yet...",
      "type": "textarea"
    },
    {
      "label": "Decade when photo captured",
      "max": 2200,
      "min": 1800,
      "name": "decade",
      "placeholder": "Between 1800 and 2200",
      "step": 10,
      "type": "number"
    },
    {
      "label": "Is a premium photo",
      "name": "premiumPhoto",
      "type": "checkbox"
    },
    {
      "label": "Attribution",
      "name": "attribution",
      "placeholder": "No attribution yet"
    },
    {
      "name": "location",
      "label": "Location",
      "type": "location"
    },
    {
      "label": "Copyright",
      "name": "copyright",
      "placeholder": "pick oneâ€¦",
      "type": "select",
      "options": [
        { "title": "Copyright", "value": "copyright" },
        { "title": "Public Domain", "value": "public-domain" },
        { "title": "Creative Commons", "value": "creative-commons" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Contributing

If you run into problems or have feature requests, please create an issue or pull request and I'll look into it as soon as I can.

## Development

Run `yarn dev` in the root folder to make changes.

Optional: To use the included studio while developing, make a symlink inside the `/test/studio/plugins` folder that links to the root directory. Then run `sanity start` in `test/studio`. You can also add the plugin to the plugins directory in a Sanity studio of your own.

## Testing

Create a Sanity bot token with write access at [manage.sanity.io](manage.sanity.io). Add a dataset named 'testing'. Then make a .env file inside the `/test` folder:

```
SANITY_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_TOKEN=<SANITY_WRITE_API_TOKEN>
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
```
